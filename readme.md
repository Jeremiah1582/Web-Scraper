Web-Scraper-1.0

WHAT is it? This app scrapes information from the listed webpages, focusing on "a-tags" that contain a specified keyword. Then the algorithm builds and returns an API from the information you've specified.

HOW does it work? I will be using the tutorial from Ania Kibov from Youtube ("https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=free+product+api%27s&docid=608004517352515980&mid=8F787BDF75FC69C2CD108F787BDF75FC69C2CD10&view=detail&FORM=VIRE")

This project will use: NodeJs Cheerio JavaScript

I have created an indexing tool that can scrape information from a website. the information scrapped relates to the key word i have selected in my code ("climate"). the tool now scrapes information from an array of news websites relating to climate. It takes this relevant information and sends it back to the user in a json format. This is your API.

This concept can be scaled to build APIS of all sorts.

WHY build it? This is a project that will be published on the Rapid API platform and generate revenue for me as the creator. This is my first attempt at building this project.
