Web-Scraper-1.0

WHAT is it? This app scrapes information from the listed webpages, focusing on a-tags that contain a specified keyword ("climate"). Then the algorithm builds and returns an API from the information you've specified.

HOW does it work? I will be using the tutorial from Ania Kibov from Youtube ("https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=free+product+api%27s&docid=608004517352515980&mid=8F787BDF75FC69C2CD108F787BDF75FC69C2CD10&view=detail&FORM=VIRE")

This project will use: NodeJs, Cheerio, JavaScript

The tool now scrapes information from an array of news webpages, with article titles/ a-tags related to "climate". It takes the relevant information and sends it back to the user in a json format. the returned information is your API.

This concept can be scaled to build APIS of all sorts.

WHY build it?
This is a project that will be published on the Rapid API platform and generate a small amount of revenue for me as the creator. This is my first attempt at using my tech stack to build passive income.
